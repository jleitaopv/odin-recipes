    <h1>Spaghetti alla Carbonara</h1>
    <p>
      Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano
      cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add
      extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if
      you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from
      Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!

    <h2>What Is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>
    <p>
      Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its
      signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot
      pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot
      enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.
